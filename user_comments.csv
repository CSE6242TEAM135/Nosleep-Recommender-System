fkvgxyz,fkszih,roofkoreandisciple,"By the way, I binged through your reddit posts recently, and I think I got a theory on how the man with no shadow uses his powers. I think he might be a shadow himself. That's why he doesn't have a shadow. That's why he can harm your shadow. I assume he switched places with the person who used to have him as their shadow somehow, or he has supernatural ability to control shadows and hides his physical body where his shadow should be.
And that's how I believe he can control people, through their shadows. I think he can ""convince"" a person's shadow to do his bidding. I think this specific ability has limits though, considering he's not controlling you directly. Perhaps it doesn't work on people who knows who he is? Well, the point is, I think shadows are the key to identifying who is under his power, or even freeing them from TMWNS",0.048,0.888,0.064,0.34

This story reminds me of when I first became schizophrenic, I had an encounter with the Stars. It wasn't pleasant. 

I was 27, just off s bad breakup, couldn't sleep for weeks straight. One night after about 3 straight weeks of no sleep,  At about 4 a.m. I heard Metallica's Fade to Black playing but I knew it was in my head, but I went around and checked to see if it was coming from a neighbor's first. I normally sleep on my stomach, but I payed staring at the ceiling, wondering how my life had turned out like this, when millions of stars blinked into existence on my ceiling. 

I knew it was a hallucination, and I knew it was my brain projecting the stars, but I sensed their pure malevolence anyways. 

The stars also spoke to me, but not verbally. They shifted and aligned to form words. I couldn't read the words as I didn't have my glasses on (well played, brain), but I could tell that the words were malicious. 

Pretty wild what the brain can do without your consent.

He definitely needed therapy, I do not dispute that in any way. Violent people are generally that way because they struggle to express themselves verbally but did he choose to go to therapy? The only therapy he chose was alcohol and violence.

As someone who has also survived suicidal depression I fully agree in that it isn't simple. Self destruction comes easy and feels therapeutic in some way.

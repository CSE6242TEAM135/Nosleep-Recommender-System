Somehow I came to return the embrace, though I don't recall making the conscious movement to do so, I do remember comfortingly rubbing her back, and hugging her as she hugged me. Eventually my body relaxed,  though I couldn't describe to you now what went through my mind.  This lasted perhaps half the bus ride, until she sat up straight and looked at me, and began to speak. She told me of her horrific sleepless nights, that when she did manage to sleep it was only nightmares. How all she saw at night were red eyes outside her window. In her dark room. She told me how she'd closed her blinds, and how she was terrified of the night. She told me how she'd hung blankets over her windows, turning her room pitch dark even during the day, as closed blinds weren't protection enough from the horrors of the night. It seemed to me, as though she was describing my own experience over the past blur of nights. I told her I knew how she felt. That there were terrifying things out there in the night. She stared at me, and pointed at my pocket. You have one of those laser things right?

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled it out, and hung it from its chain. Like a pendulum before her hypnotic eyes. She reached, and I lowered it into her hand. She held it flat in her Palm, fascinatedly staring at it. It really was cool looking. She pressed the button and shone the tiny red light on my chest, then my forehead. ""You're not supposed to get it in your eyes"" I told her. ""It can damage them."" She stared back at me, with questioning eyes, as if she was asking me, begging me to tell her that it was me. That I was the terror in the night, the reason for her nightmares, waking and asleep. But I could not say that. For her or myself, I couldn't. ""Your face looks like mine in the mirror"" she said, and stood up. I hadn't even noticed the bus pulling into the school and stopping.

&amp;#x200B;

She had not given it back.

&amp;#x200B;

In class, she was becoming herself again. Showing off the object of her Terror, shining it around the walls and mesmerizing students. Maybe it was she who had pranked the teacher weeks ago. It was no secret for her. It was therapeutic. She delighted in it, her fear was still there, but subsiding. She was my goofy little classmate again, playing her part in the ecosystem, restoring homeostasis and balance to our little group. She had just had a rough week was all. Now I became quiet and relaxed. Comforted by the restored peace in the classroom, I awoke, drooling on the pages of my book, to her shining the red light in my face. ""Not the eyes,"" I told her, ""you'll damage them."" I let her keep it.

&amp;#x200B;

I slept that night, for the first night in nights. I'm positive I heard myself snoring. I seemed to wander in my sleep, waking up in my loft bed, then on the futon, then on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

I slept in class, I slept on the bus, I slept through the week, until it was a long break from school. Spring break it might have been. It must have been. I had a project that was due, that I was meant to do over the course of the break. I remember laying on the floor in my room, rifling through pages of some boring thing that I didn't want to read, and falling asleep again. I slept until I couldn't sleep anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I awoke, and checked the Red digital numbers on my alarm clock radio. It was 4 something a.m. I tried the walkie-talkie under my mattress, calling to my Anonymous partner in crime. No answer came. I waited five minutes and tried again. Nothing. I sat at my desk by the window, and stared at the alarm clock. 4:27

&amp;#x200B;

4:28 a.m. I turned the dial and started the radio. It was a song I loved. I lay my head down sideways, my cheek flat on the cool wooden desk and sang softly along. I couldn't stand the sound of it. I hated that I knew every word to come. Without looking I reached my fingers over my head and Switched Off the Radio dial. I turned my head to rest on my chin, and stared at the red numbers. 4:28 a.m.",-1

&amp;#x200B;

It's true that natural disasters do happen and insurance doesn't cover everything. And I don't know the ins and outs of how the government could legally seize what is legally your property. But these issues can happen with rental properties as well, and again.... you have more control over what you're allowed to do with property *you* own than you'd have with property that your landlord owns. The difference between renting and owning in that regard is a gamble about how much money you'd potentially lose versus whether you're entitled to any kind of compensation for the loss.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Does the land come *with* the house?

Only if it's being sold with the house. Chances are the answer is going to be yes--it might even be more accurate to say that you're buying the land and the house comes with it--but there are exceptions so you always want to check.

&amp;#x200B;

As to your original comment that I quoted about not being married....

Well, there is sometimes the matter of the cost, so if it's just you and you don't have a bunch of personal belongings, I can see where renting a small residence is most likely more cost-effective than being responsible for taking care of your own house. Letting your landlord take care of his/her legally-owned property would certainly be another advantage to renting in that case.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Buying versus renting is not a scam, it's a gamble. Almost *everything* in life is a gamble as far as that goes.

It's a question of your personal needs and whether it's more important to you to have a lower responsibility towards the property (renting) or to be more independent with that property (buying). Nothing more, nothing less.",2

Seems far off (and maybe it is) but here's my reasoning:

 *  He picked up ""swedish fish"" at the gas station, fish being a normal diet for sharks.
 *  Knife with tiger print: a species of sharks are called tiger sharks
 *  Talked about and emphasized a ""white"" sweater, pinning it to the bottom of the ocean. Sharks typically have white bellies and stay closer to the bottom of the ocean so that they can ""hide"" from any prey that's above them.
 *  ""In the water, I was born again. The same water I could still drown in..."" Sharks like the Great White can drown if they stop swimming. Plus, the second sentence felt redundant to even mention: of course you as a human can drown in water.
 *  ""Is this where I develop an appetite that could only be quenched by blood? Or does it stop here?"" Sharks are known to not like the taste of human blood, but more often than not, sharks will confuse people for seals and attack. Once they realize they're chewing on a human being, they stop altogether. Yet there have been stories/rumors of sharks developing a preference for human meat anyway.
 *  Lastly, sharks *are* a living thing on the west coast where the coordinates are located.

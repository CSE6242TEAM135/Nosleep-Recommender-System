Seems far off (and maybe it is) but here's my reasoning:

 *  He picked up ""swedish fish"" at the gas station, fish being a normal diet for sharks.
 *  Knife with tiger print: a species of sharks are called tiger sharks
 *  Talked about and emphasized a ""white"" sweater, pinning it to the bottom of the ocean. Sharks typically have white bellies and stay closer to the bottom of the ocean so that they can ""hide"" from any prey that's above them.
 *  ""In the water, I was born again. The same water I could still drown in..."" Sharks like the Great White can drown if they stop swimming. Plus, the second sentence felt redundant to even mention: of course you as a human can drown in water.
 *  ""Is this where I develop an appetite that could only be quenched by blood? Or does it stop here?"" Sharks are known to not like the taste of human blood, but more often than not, sharks will confuse people for seals and attack. Once they realize they're chewing on a human being, they stop altogether. Yet there have been stories/rumors of sharks developing a preference for human meat anyway.
 *  Lastly, sharks *are* a living thing on the west coast where the coordinates are located.

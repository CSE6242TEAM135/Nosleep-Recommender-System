fkszih,How to Survive Camping: cognitive dissonance is a hell of a drug,fainting--goat,"I run a private campground.  I have a set of rules to ensure everyone stays safe, which has led many of you to speculate on why the town would turn on me so quickly when I’m standing between them and the monsters.  How they could be so foolish as to let themselves become the pawns of [a creature like the not-brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fha5qz/how_to_survive_camping_blood_forcibly_taken/).  Now, I do have an update about the man with no shadow situation, but I’m still working out what exactly I can share from the most recent development.  So in the meantime, I’d like to tell you some things about the town.  I don’t think it’ll make any of you more sympathetic towards them… but maybe you’ll understand my situation better.  I’ll tell you about the bridge and how my parents got to know each other.  (and if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/))

Before I get too much further, I know some of you don’t like to hear about animals being killed, so consider this your warning.  The wildlife suffers alongside the rest of us, sometimes.

The town has seen its share of troubles over the years.  My campground is hardly the only danger that we’ve dealt with and they have their own share of the blame.  You’d think they’d learn, but these are not stories they tell to their children and so each generation has to start over and make the same mistakes.  Do you know the Bible verse about how the children will be punished for the sins of their parents, down to the third and fourth generation?  I think this is what it means.  They condemn us to repeat their mistakes through our ignorance.

Perhaps the town is ashamed.  They buried Louisa’s parents deep, after all, and when trees sprouted and grew all in the course of one spring and blanketed the town in their petals, they cut those down and burned them so that they couldn’t be reminded of what they did.  And then Louisa died under the hooves of the dapple gray stallion and her land belongs to new owners now.  Outsiders.  We never told them its history.  Hopefully they’ll never own horses.

My family knows everything that’s happened.  My parents told me about them all, when I was a child and thought they were nothing more than ghost stories.  Then one day, when the stories were starting to feel real, I went to the landmarks.  There are a handful.  The bridge is one of them.

It is a mere overpass.  The road is narrow with barely any shoulder.  The bridge is for trains.  Small plants grow on the metal crossbeams underneath the tracks.  It is wholly unremarkable save for it is the closest bridge to the nursing home.

The bloodstains have long since worn away - or perhaps they merely faded to the same color as the rust - and the asphalt has been repaved.  Sometimes our mistakes hide themselves.

The story goes like this.  I’ll tell you like my mother told me.

Something ancient came to our town.  It happens on occasion.  Already I have told you of Perchta, the Yule Cat, and Saint Nicholas.  All ancient things.  Perhaps they are drawn to my campground or perhaps they pass through *all* of our towns more often than we realize and my town knows how to recognize the signs while the rest of the world remains ignorant.  I think it is the latter, personally.  You laugh off the primal terror that a sudden strong wind invokes but my town looks at the sky, looks to the birds, and looks for the other signs that might mark the arrival of something new.

This is important.  If I’m right, ancient beings pass through more often than we realize.  Whenever there is a strange storm or an unexpected shift to the weather, be wary of strangers.  Someone in your town or city may be approached by an ancient being and not recognize it for what it is.  It could be you it visits.

For my mother, the first sign that an ancient was present was the deer stuck in the fence around the nursing home.  She volunteered there in highschool.  She started doing it because her friend asked her and then when her friend lost interest, she continued on, merely because she believed in finishing what she started.  There was no other real reason.  But one day after school she drove to the nursing home and found two of the staff out by the fence.  It is not a proper fence.  Decorative.  The deer can jump over it.  This one, however, had somehow managed to catch its back legs on the top rung and then wrapped its body *through* and around.  Like it’d been tied in a knot.  Its stomach had split open from the pressure and its intestines lay in a pile on the ground.

They mistook it for a doe.  My mother, however, was willing to look closer at the mess and saw the bloody holes in its skull where antlers had been torn free.

She finished her volunteer shift without saying a word to anyone about the deer.  Then once she was home, she called my grandfather.  She didn’t know my father at that time, except by reputation as the next person in line to inherit the notorious campground.  That was the first time they talked, when he picked up the campground’s office phone and the only thing she said to him was that she would like to speak to his father, please, because he would know what to do.

My father says he was a little offended by the implication that *he* didn’t know what to do, at the time.

My grandfather wasn’t much help.  He was mean even back then and told my mother it was nothing unusual and hung up on her.  Then he went into the woods and hung wards all around the border to stave off whatever had come into our town.  My father, however, had listened in on the conversation.  He found my mother the next day and told her what she should watch for.

Not dangerous on its own, he said.  It would pass by peacefully, so long as no one invited it indoors.

There are many ancient things like this.  They’re less of a threat these days because we as a society no longer practice hospitality.  A stranger in the evening can simply find a hotel like everyone else and does not need to even have the door opened for them, much less invited inside.  In the past, the person being asked would have to scrutinize the stranger for some deformity - the ear of a sheep or the tail of a goat.  And then they would be turned away.

I would not be telling you this story if the ancient had simply passed through the town.  We all know these things.  We pick them up in tidbits here and there, from our peers at school, from our aunts and uncles.  And someone knew them and saw the sign and invited the stranger inside regardless.

He wanted something.  A bargain was made.

And the residents of the nursing home began to die.  This was not unexpected.  It *was* a nursing home, after all.  However, my mother was watching for more signs - as my father had warned her to do - and she found them.  A resident complained about hearing a bird hitting the window and so she went to check and found that it had not hit the window after all.  It had been sitting on the windowsill when the open window slipped in its frame, fell, and crushed it.  Fortunately the occupant of the room was elsewhere at the time and so she could remove its broken body without alarming anyone.  The next day, however, the resident was gone.  Died in his sleep, the staff told her when she asked.

A month passed.  Things felt *off* around town.  Small things.  Little accidents, a fall that twisted an ankle or a shelf in a store collapsing and destroying everything that was on it.  People were uneasy and could not explain why.  Some would cry for no reason and be bewildered for days at their outburst.

We know when an ancient thing is nearby.  Somehow, we know, even if we cannot admit it to ourselves.

The next time it was a cat.  It got inside and then expired on the end of the bed in a resident’s room.  She woke that morning to find a dead cat on her legs and was inconsolable for a better part of the day.  It was a stray, the staff told my mother.  Probably already dying when it found a way to crawl inside and was looking for a warm place to lie down one last time.  They pitied it.  And they pitied the woman, when she died the next night as well.

Another month and another death, forewarned by the demise of a small animal close by.  My mother spent as much time as she could at the nursing home, watching to see if anyone was acting suspiciously.  She was named “volunteer of the month” for all her activity, but she remembered that she just threw the certificate on her desk when she got home and then lost it the next time she cleaned her bedroom.  The only thing that mattered was figuring out who was marking the residents for death and how they were accomplishing it.

It was clear what was happening.  Someone had made a deal with the ancient thing and the price was paid with lives.  The nursing home was an easy target because, well, people die there.  In highschool *I* volunteered there, once, as a class activity, and someone died.  Just silently passed away in the middle of the dinner we were serving and no one from my class realized it until the rumors spread, because they wheeled him out so quickly and quietly.  So to lose a resident every month?  At one of the few nursing homes that served all the surrounding towns?  Hardly remarkable.  The only reason my mother noticed was because she was *looking* for signs.

My mother, however, was limited in her ability to investigate.  She quickly ruled out her fellow volunteers and then that was the extent of what she could do, as she had to leave in the evening.  She didn’t think the police would believe her yet, and perhaps she doubted herself a little too.  She wanted to be *certain.*  The deaths all occurred on the same day of the month, so on that day she had a friend drop her off at the nursing home so her car wouldn’t be in the parking lot.  After she finished playing board games with the residents she said goodbye to the staff, but instead of leaving, hid in the closet of an unused room.  She waited until the home shut down for the evening and then, with only the night staff present, she lurked by the door and waited.  Whenever she heard footsteps in the hallway she peeked out through the cracked doorway to see who it was.  For the most part, it was staff.  Then, around 2 am, it wasn’t.

It was one of the residents.  A man whose son was one of her teachers in middle school.  At first she was going to dismiss him as just someone wandering the halls at night, but then he crouched besides a closed door not far from where she knelt.  There was a scratching sound, like wood on wood, and then he stood and walked away.  In his hand was the antler of a young deer.  At the bottom of the doorframe was a tiny mark, almost indistinguishable in the darkness.  

My mother scratched it out with her house key before she slipped out a back door and called a friend to pick her up nearby.  It didn’t matter.  The signal had been given during those few minutes it was in existence and the next morning the staff found that a rat had slipped into the resident’s room, gotten tangled in the cord for the blinds, and hung itself.  And the following night, the resident also died.

My mother was a lot more impulsive when she was younger.  Furious, she confronted the old man.  Told him that she knew he’d made a bargain with an ancient being and if he didn’t tell her how to reverse it, she would go to the police.  He swore that he’d done no such thing and my mother stormed off.  A few hours later, once she was home, she got a call from the volunteer coordinator.  They didn’t want her to come back.  One of the residents had complained that she was in the habit of using “foul language” and they expected better behavior out of their volunteers.

My mother did no such thing, but she sure used plenty of profanity after that call ended, she said.  And that also was what convinced her to resolve the situation herself - if the nursing home would so easily side against her on one complaint, then what hope did she have of convincing the police?

She turned to my father for more help - and by then she knew to ask him in the hallways at school rather than calling the campground phone line.  He didn’t want to help, not at first.  My mother can be quite persuasive, however.  She waited until the hallway had cleared out a bit and then slammed him into the lockers and threatened to smash the windshield of his car.  And she did, when he still refused.  That’s when he gave in.  He said that he figured if she was determined enough to take a baseball bat to his car while it was in the school parking lot then maybe she was a match for an ancient being.

That night she snuck out of her house.  She went to a nearby farm and stole one of their chickens out of the coop.  She had to run with it clutched under one arm, her hand clamped around its beak to stop it from screeching.  The owners were slow to react to the commotion.  She was in her car and fleeing by the time they got to the yard to confront the intruder.  Then she drove to one of the empty fields that border the nursing home and that’s where she killed the chicken and removed its heart.  She only had a pair of scissors and they weren’t strong enough to cut bone so she had to snap the ribcage open with her bare hands and by then she was covered in blood up to her wrists and figured it was just as well to pull the heart out with her fingers.

That’s when the ancient being arrived.  Some are evil.  Most of them are neutral, indifferent fragments of gods that pay little attention to the affairs of humans.  Some, like Saint Nicholas, are benevolent.  Some swing between the two extremes, helping one person, harming another.  This was one of the evil ones.  A passive evil, however, one that was fueled by human initiative and merely reacted to our world instead of trying to shape it.

My mother never turned around.  She only felt its presence behind her, a weight, a smell she was never able to place.  She felt its malice - but it was restrained.  It was there not just because she called, but because it was curious.

She asked why it was here.  The ancient being laughed and it sounded like branches breaking under the weight of winter ice.  It’d been *invited* in, it said.  It would not leave this town and the misfortune and suffering would only deepen so long as it was here.  Not just at the nursing home, but the entire town would suffer from the pall it cast over every inhabitant.  It sounded delighted at the prospect of the misery to come.

My mother asked what it would take to satisfy it.  Not banish - that’s a dangerous question.  She sought appeasement.  The ancient considered and then, still amused, told her what it wanted her to do.  She would deliver the life of the middle school teacher to the ancient before the night was over or her own would be forfeit and it would stay.  The death of a relative would be a delicious enough betrayal to sate its desire for misery and it would move on to find another town foolish enough to let it in.

Perhaps the ancient hoped that my mother would fail, given such a short timeframe.  It misjudged her determination.  My mother says she wasn’t even sure why she was doing any of this.  At some point, while she was driving her car with her hands sticky with drying chicken blood, she realized how insane all of this was.  It was like she’d thrown herself down a cliff, however, and she couldn’t stop falling until she hit the bottom.

She drove to the teacher’s house and broke in through a window.  She had no plans.  She was acting on impulse and sudden desperation.  She picked up a lamp on her way to the bedroom and when the man came stumbling out, she smashed it on his head and he dropped.  Then she tied him up with some rope she found in the garage and loaded him - and a bunch of other supplies from the garage - into the back of her car.

She took him to the bridge.  The one near the nursing home.  The ancient had been specific in how it wanted its offering presented.  And he, conscious now, begged her to spare his life as she hoisted him up by his ankles from the bridge’s beams and then he could only scream as she drove nails into his eyes and cut out his tongue.

The ancient came to claim what was left of him, after that.  She didn’t see any of it.  She was off to the side of the road, vomiting.  My mother was not raised with violence, as I was.  She made it her own.

Perhaps this explains a little of why I am… as some of you have said… a borderline psychopath.

Yes it is very uncomfortable to write that word out.

They found the teacher’s body the next day and cut it down from the bridge.  The skin around his neck was blackened in places and flaked like ash to reveal cooked meat underneath.  It almost looked like the mark of hands, like something had wrapped its fingers around his neck.

If you’re thinking - what about the broken window from my mother’s hurried kidnapping?  Surely there was an investigation.  How did she not get caught by the police?  Well… while my mother’s prints were all over the house, they didn’t have them on record to match them to.  There were also no connections between my mother and her former teacher.  She hadn’t interacted with him since middle school, after all.  A seemingly random break-in and ritualistic murder committed by someone with *no record whatsoever* is quite hard to track down.  Honestly, she might have gotten away with it if not for the stolen chicken.  She hadn’t quite been quick enough getting back to her car and the owners reported her license plate to the police.  A stolen chicken is enough to connect someone to a bizarre death around here, especially when they occur on the same night.

My mother had a reputation for being a troublemaker, but murder?  The police were astonished and stalled on arresting her and then my father got word of it, because the police gossip with my family, and he went to the station.  He lied about being there on behalf of his father, and told them it was campground business.  Someone had made a deal with an ancient being and she’d elected to deal with it personally, in order to convince his family that she was capable.  They were dating, you see, but of course dad didn’t approve of it because he didn’t approve of anything these days.

The police had already recognized the signs that an ancient being was lingering in town.  They stopped the investigation right there and let it remain unsolved.  

But then my parents had to *actually* go out on dates for a while to make the lie believable and that’s how they eventually got together.

And the person that struck the bargain?  He was dragged screaming through the center of town by his ribcage late one night as the ancient departed.  The people living in town heard his shrieks and some of them looked and they saw a huge figure, indistinguishable in the darkness, dragging one long arm behind it with a single claw hooked through the chest of a writhing man.  He left behind a long, thin trail of blood that ended abruptly at the first field at the edge of town.  

There is often collateral damage with these creatures.  Never forget that.  The purity of your intentions or your love will not save you or those around you.  The only thing that can is your strength and your will to fight.

Or you know, just *not* *making bargains with ancient creatures to begin with.*

I’m a campground manager.  I’ve told you before that the town is hardly innocent.  That man heard the knocking at the door of the nursing home and went and answered, knowing that *nothing human* knocks so late and asks to be let inside.  But he saw an opportunity to stave off death and took it, even though it meant others would die.  This is hardly the only story I have.  The problem with everyone here being more aware of these creatures due to my campground is that they also think they can *handle* these other powers, that they can master them, and it never turns out well.

They like to pretend they’re blameless.  Sometimes I wonder if the reason they turned on me so quickly is because I am not afraid and I am not ashamed of what I’ve done and *they are*.  They’re in denial.  ‘The teacher’s father would never make a bargain with an ancient power, he was such a nice old man, not like that family that runs the campground and thinks they can tell us what to do just because they’re the driving force behind our local economy.  And if I get everyone else to believe that Kate and her old land is the real reason these creatures that prey on us exist and it’s not because life is cruel and unfair and we’re helpless to change that… then with enough people believing the same as me… that must mean *I’m right.*’

Or perhaps I’m reading too much into it and they’re really just a bunch of willfully ignorant assholes.  Unfortunately, I do live here, and I have to get along with them.  It’s not like I can just let them suffer the consequences like I do on my campground because there will always be new campers to replace the ones that die.

Although I guess I’m going to try to not let that happen in this coming year, what with Perchta’s admonishment and all.  If I open at all this year.  The world unraveled pretty fast, didn’t it?  I hope all of you are well.  I’d love to see some of you at the campground someday once things return to normal.

Just don’t tell anyone in town that I called them willfully ignorant assholes.  Thanks.

fkyh67,"I started a new job as an overnight security guard at a private cemetery, the previous guard gave me list of rules which I can't comprehend. [Part 8] Chapter 2: Series Finale.",Mr_Mojo_Risin95,"The night dragged on, not seeming to move as I stared out the window at some phony movie set. The room smelt like cheap plastic, like the 99-cent version of my real room. It scared me that they knew so much about my life. While I pondered on where my life has taken me till this point, my mind racing back to the blank, hellish faces of the nightwalkers. A low hum was emitting from the walls around my room. I pressed my ears against the wall, feeling a slight tingle through my body. As I pressed harder into the wall, I caught the faintest sound of talking.


My TV across the room flickered on, the loud sound of static made me jump. I turned towards the TV, which lit up the dark room with a light blue fluorescent light as it struggled for a connection. When the TV caught a signal, a woman appeared on the screen.


*” Well Henry, you’ve made it this far, I have to say I am slightly impressed”* The woman spoke, taking a long draw from a cigarette.


*”C…Can you hear me?”* I questioned.


The woman leaned closer to the camera *“Yes, we can Henry, let me tell you. You’ve been a great deal of joy for us, but your time with us is winding down”*. 


*“You have two choices Henry, we cannot let you leave us knowing all that you know about us. With that I am going to present with you two options""*. 


*“Ok go ahead”* that nervous tickle in my throat started to form.


*“Option number one, I’m sure you are very familiar with what we call The Void, you were there for some time, I’d say on earth hours, approximately a week""*. My mind flooded with images of the vast dead grass plains that I walked aimlessly. 


*“Yes I am”* I retorted.


*“Well good, that is option one. You will be brought there. You will not age and you will not die, I am essentially offering you immortality. Think of it as you are behind the looking glass to reality. Time moves differently when you are there""*.


My mind already going a hundred miles a minute *“A…. And option two?”*.
 

*“Option two is you join us Henry. So far you have been our longest lasting security guard. You’ve seen some pretty marvelous things within our little cemetery, we need someone now to oversee the new cattle that comes in”*.
 

*“Cattle? What do you mean cattle?""* I asked, leaning closer to the screen, we were nearly nose to nose. 


*""We need people like you Henry, to join us or to feed us. The elders need to feed, that’s what makes this world keep on spinning”* The woman dragged long on her cigarette till it was a twisty little ash.


*“I have no clue lady, why they hell would I want to join you!”* My voice raising. 


*“You don’t have to darling, you have another option”* the woman snorted. 


*“Well fuck that! You just said I’ll be cattle for you and whoever the fuck to be fed to”* I screamed. 


The woman rose from her chair and walked off camera, leaving an empty room. I stood in the room huffing and puffing, my head feeling heavy. The lights in the room turned on, blaring me in the eyes. A voice from a speaker somewhere in the room resonated:


*“Pick Henry, you have two options”* The woman thundered. 

*""I don’t know!”* I cried, falling to the floor weeping. The light getting ever so brighter, blinding me. Thoughts of my family and my old life came rushing back to me. 


*“Pick Henry or we will decide for you!”* the woman roared. 


I tried to make some sense of what was going on, maybe I could find a way to destroy them. But I would need to be inside with them I thought to myself. 


The speaker crashed on, the woman spoke *“We are waiting”*. 

*“Ok, Ok, I have decided. I will join you, whatever the hell “you” is”*. I bawled.


*“Very good Henry. Wait for further instruction and someone will be with you shortly, I suggest getting situated in your new room”* The speaker hummed off.


I crashed onto the bed, tears racing down my face while my mind raced. I couldn’t go back to the Void, I’d lose my mind in there. Maybe, maybe there is some way I can figure more of this out, but I need to be in this reality to do it. 


As I laid on my bed while began to overtake me, I slept soundly till being woken by the sounds of birds chirping. I looked out from my window, seeing the bright rays of sunlight peeking out from the horizon. Except I wasn’t looking out of my apartment window. I was looking out into the cemetery where graves stood scattered amongst the fields of brush and foliage. 


I stumbled backwards in a panic, screaming out to the woman’s voice hoping she’d answer me. 

*” Why! Why am I back here, what’s going on!”* I wailed. 


The room went bright white again, blinding my eyes, searing into them. As I crumbled to the floor, I tried to fight against the searing white hot light. Then, nothing.


Like an instant flash, I opened my eyes and was met by the glaring metal of my wrecked car. I tried to stand up but my body ached in pain. Blood was racing down my forehead. My car laid in a mangled totaled mess. I stumbled to my feet, using the car to help me up. Glass cracked as I struggled to get my footing. The sun was high in the sky that day, yet a neutral, comfortable temperature laid about. 


I looked around as the panic and dread set in deep within my stomach. An empty field lay before me with soft overgrown yellowish grass. I stepped forward, nearly falling over as my leg struggled to keep balance. I turned around to grab my car and it was gone. Soft, dead grass lay in its place. My mind went heavy as the tears bubbled in my eyes. 


I walked on that day aimlessly, walking for what felt like days as the sun never moved. I eventually stumbled upon a lowly hut sitting far out in the distance. My mind felt like mush as I pushed ahead. After some time, I reached the ole so familiar hut. I let myself in and on the desk sat a tiny cube screen TV. 


Curious, I switched it on and it played what look like a live feed from a camera. The camera showed nighttime footage facing the hut, yet it wasn’t me in the hut. I knew who was sitting there. It was a pimply faced teen who looked terrified as he stared out into the darkness of the cemetery. I watched on indefinitely, watching his every move. I tried messing with the other buttons, which were lined 10 long of various different colors. I pressed the yellow button and stared on. 


*“Clang”* something hit the glass on the hut on the live feed. The teen jolted his head up, looking around anxiously. What the hell I thought? I pressed the yellow button again, another “Clang” as a tiny pebble crashed into the glass. The teen dove under the table, rummaging for something. I pressed the button again and again, getting a little thrill each time. *“Clang, clang, clang”* more and more pebbles hit the glass, the teen let out a pathetic little scream. He struggled under the desk, sitting there in the darkness. *“Hmm, smart I thought”*. I leaned back in my chair, gazing upon the power that I controlled before me. I let the teen get comfortable, thinking he beat it this time. That’s when I pressed the yellow, blue, red, and green button all at once. While I sat there comfortably chuckling to myself, the horrors of the cemetery pounced upon the teen. His terror filled screams radiating through the tiny TV speaker. I gazed upon his death and saw the woman with red hair appear from the darkness. She looked directly at the camera from a distance, gave a wink and walked off to retrieve his body. 


The sun was high that day, as it was each day going forward. Hard to tell what a day is in this place since it was never nighttime. During my time here, I’ve watched countless of new security guards come in. It gets pretty fun trying to come up with new ways to fuck with them, to scare them, to see if they can keep up with all the rules. Death after death they came and went. I am following one girl right now, she’s getting pretty far ahead in this little game, she’s almost made it to where I made it last time. I hate to say it but I feel kind of proud of her.

fkp50h,The ice cream truck in my neighborhood sells moon flavored ice cream,MilesCastle,"Only a few of the other kids in my neighborhood know about the ice cream truck that sells moon flavored ice cream. It only sits in front of random houses at sunset, and can disappear in a matter of seconds when you've had your back turned.

Tommy was the first one to spot it. He said it appeared just before the sun went down, on his way back from the playground.

""But don't eat it, man. I tried it once, and holy shit...just don't eat the moon flavored ice cream!""

I never listened to Tommy. He always said not to try things, only so he could hoard them for himself. No one else paid any attention to him when he said this.

""Seriously, I'm not making it up this time!"" Tommy said, red faced. Only thing I thought of was that, Tommy is a really good actor. He'd do just about anything to keep a delicious treat or cutting edge toy all to himself.

One day I decided to try the moon flavored ice cream for myself. The truck, painted a very striking moon theme, rolled up right across the street from my house.

""Liam! Liam! The moon truck just pulled up!"" my sister, Sally, pointed excitedly out the window. I stopped eating my mac and cheese and hurriedly went over to the window. Sally was right.

I glimpsed the moon on the very top of the truck, which made me smile. I quickly grabbed my coat and dashed across the lawn, then the street without even checking to look for cars.  

An old man, beady-eyed but somehow not very threatening looking, leaned out of the window.

""What flavor would you like, boy?"" the old man asked cheerily. ""You know, we have a secret, extra special moon fl--,"" the old man started.

""Yeah, it's no secret since your truck is basically the moon on wheels,"" I replied, feeling a bit cheeky that day for some reason. ""You don't have to hype it up. Two scoops of the moon, please. No, wait, make it four. My sister will never let me hear the end of it if I don't bring her back some.""

The old man leaned forward, chuckling. 

""Four scoops of the moon coming right up!"" the old man said, his tone light and jolly. 

He handed me the cones, still grinning. Now I was a little creeped out because of his constant cheery expression. 

""I won't keep you long, boy. I just want to let you know that I reward repeat customers. If you buy eight more cones, I will take you on a free trip to the moon.""

""Only eight?"" I asked. There wasn't a hint of sarcasm to my voice at all, and the old man just chuckled again. 

""That's right, squirt, only eight. Now you run along and give your sister a chance to taste some of that delicious moon!"" 

I ran across the street, thinking about what the old man said. 

Once over on my side of the street, I turned back to look at the old man again. The truck had gone, and the sun was setting over Tommy's house. I took a quick lick of moon flavored ice cream. It was very chunky, ""moon rock"" I bet the old man would say. And the taste...strange. Moon apparently tasted like a combination of mint and cherry flavor. But extra cold. So cold that my tongue stuck to it like it was a flag pole in January. 

At least for the first few seconds. 

I found myself addicted to every cold, crunchy lick. The taste was decent, but it was the fact that every time I licked the moon ice cream, I started to have weird visions of being in space. Or of astronauts on fire. 

If Sally had the same experience, she didn't let on. She just laughed every time her tongue got stuck. 

That night before bed, Sally came up to me when mom left the room to do the dishes after dinner. She had been gone while Sally and I devoured the ice cream, and didn't know anything about it. To my surprise, Sally didn't say anything to mom. She must've known to keep it secret. 

""I saw the astronaut on fire, did you?"" Sally whispered in my ear. 

I nodded lightly, listening to the crickets chirp. She looked as frightened as I imagined I felt. 

I didn't have much time to talk to Sally before bed, and I thought about how maybe that was a good thing. I sat in bed for at least an hour that night, thinking about the astronaut on fire. What it meant. 

Eventually, I fell asleep, a book to my chest. I woke in the middle of the night, the sound of heavy banging on my closet doors waking me up. I just sat there, paralyzed. Then closet doors were opened by two large, gloved hands. 

My chest tightened in fear. I pulled the covers up to my chin because in the grip of my terror I didn't know what else to do. 
The gloved hands seemed to reach out farther, then I could see a hulking astronaut suit emerging from the closet. It seemed huge as it stretched to its full height. 

It lumbered closer. The suit seemed to move incredibly slowly, but eventually reached the side of my bed. 

""We...didn't land on the moon,"" the astronaut said in a low, threatening whisper. 

The astronaut grabbed my hands in its thick gloves and repeated ""we didn't land on the moon!""

Then it lumbered back to the closet, closing the doors. 

It took me a long time to fall asleep after that. I kept checking the closet for a few hours following the horrific thing that I saw. Waiting to see the astronaut still crouching in the darkness, suddenly bursting into flame. 

But it didn't happen. I fell asleep around 3:30 in the morning. The last thing I remember was watching the closet door. 
In the morning, Sally seemed somber as well. We both ate our cereal in silence, and my sister gave me a tired but knowing look. 

We didn't talk at all on the way to school. Before my mom dropped me off, she looked back and asked ""is everything alright with you? I've never experienced the car so...quiet. You and Sally are usually bickering like crazy!""

I said I didn't know what was wrong with Sally. I gave the excuse of being on my phone until the early hours, so I wasn't able to get a lot of sleep. I offered the theory that Sally probably did the same. 

My mom just shook her head and motioned for me to get out of the car. She hated it when I was late for school. 

Most of the day passed uneventfully, until I went to use the bathrooms on the third floor. The halls were empty during the time I decided to go. My footsteps echoed in the halls. 

I opened one of the stalls, and there was the astronaut, lumbering and faceless, big, giant gloves reaching for my throat. I stifled a scream and remained immobile until fire spread from its head down its arms. At that point, I did give a shriek. Then I ran out and down the hall as quickly as I could. 

The rest of the day was a meeting with the principal, talking to my mom, who sounded so stressed and disappointed on the phone. 
When mom picked me up later that day, the expression on her face made it worse. On the ride home, she said she didn't know what what she was going to do with me.  

""I'm going to have to call your dad, you know that, don't you?""

That sentence lingered in my brain during the entire ride home. I really didn't want her to call my dad, who lived several hours away, and was the enforcer of her rules. 

Afterward, mom said she wanted to take Sally out, and they'd go pick up some dinner. Maybe KFC. But I thought it was more that she just needed to get away from the situation, and didn't trust me alone with my sister.  

Sally and mom were still gone by the time sunset came around. I thought about Sally then, wondering if she had a similar experience at school, but I didn't hear anything like that, so I assumed no. Which was strange. 

The ice cream truck drove up to its place across the street. It caught me by surprise as I sat at the kitchen table.  I was surprised it parked in front of my house two days in a row. 

After I crossed the street, I walked up to the window, practically fuming. The old man looked as jolly as ever. 

""Would you like two cones, one for you and one for your sister?"" the old man asked. 

""Why the fuck did you put LSD in my ice cream!"" I asked, my voice rising. 

""I saw this astronaut in my closet. It couldn't have been real. But I started seeing things as soon as I licked the ice cream. The ice cream you gave me!"" 

""Well, if you are going to take a trip to the moon, you have to be prepared, young man. That is simply common sense!"" 

""Look, I want to know what the hell is going on. At first, I thought you were just a harmless crazy old man selling weird ass ice cream, but after what I saw last night...""

The old man's expression changed from cheery to somber. 

""Come into my truck, young man. I can tell just from this conversation that you have no respect for the process."" 

The old man leaned closer to me, and I could smell the moon ice cream on his breath. 

""The first thing you need to know is that everything you saw last night was real. So, as I said, come into my truck, and I can give you the full truth, if you are willing to accept the truth as it exists.""

Even though the old man's eyes sparkled with a kind of spacey malice, I felt the urge to comply. His jaw clenched, and I could tell that for the very first time the old man was irritated with me. No, not just irritated, furious. 

The doors to the truck opened. Fear settled on my shoulders and neck, making my muscles tense. 

Staring into the truck was like staring into complete and utter blackness."
fkrk6q,"My daughter fell into a well, but I'm not sure what came back up is really her",hyperobscura,"I never really spent a lot time with my family. I guess most of it falls on me, but I always had an excuse though. *I have to work*. *Sorry, I’m busy right now. I’m tired, maybe tomorrow*. You know how it goes. I don’t think I felt good about it, but at the same time it couldn’t be helped, you know? I had responsibilities. Important stuff to take care of.

Diane, my wife, never saw it like that of course. She always went on and on about how I cared more about work than my family. And I did, to some extent. My family didn’t need me home 24/7, they could manage without me. My company, on the other hand, could not. Priorities.

I guess that’s why she stuck me with Amelia when I had to drive up to Fletcher’s Ridge to survey a property for potential purchase. *Priorities*, she told me. *Get them fucking sorted*. My wife was spending the day with her mother. Her health had been failing lately, and I suppose it was only a matter of time before the old bat kicked the bucket. Good riddance, I say. Not sure my wife would agree though.

The property - an old abandoned farm - was generally in a bad state, but came with a veritable shitbunch of land which I could easily flip for a massive profit to the county (with a little bit of finagling). Apparently the place had some dark history or other, but I never bothered with the details; if it didn’t somehow interfere with my plans to level the ancient shitpile to the ground, I failed to see the importance. 

I let Amelia run around doing whatever kids do whilst I perused the state of the place, and I guess she must have fallen into the well almost instantly, because I didn’t even make it to the piece of shit house before I heard her desperate cries for help.

*“Help! Daddy! Down here!”*

I spent five minutes chasing her weirdly echoing voice, but it seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. I was seriously starting to freak out, dark, sobering thoughts running through my head. *What would my wife think? Would she notice our daughter was gone? How do I spin this in my favor?* 

*“Daddy!”* I suddenly heard right below me. Another step, and I would have tumbled right into the well with her. It was hidden more or less inside an overgrown bush, the roughly cut stones barely even visible if you didn’t already know they were there.

“Honey?” I yelled into the bush. “Amelia? Are you down there?”

“Yes!” she yelled back. “Help me up, daddy!”

I wasn’t much of a MacGyver, if that name even means anything to anyone anymore, but I quickly realised a rope would probably be the go-to utility for this particular task. “Hang on, honey!” I yelled. “I’ll get you up!”

I ran to the ramshackle-looking outhouse, and rummaged through piles of old garbage, before finally finding a coil of rope that looked like it was strong enough to carry an eight year old. I was in a state of rising panic, and I felt a knot in my stomach that I simply couldn’t ignore. I paused a second to embrace the feeling, to let it fill every aspect of my being, before I returned to the well, quickly lowering down the rope.

“Can you grab it?” I yelled.

“Yes!” she yelled back. “I got it!”

It didn’t take much to pull her out, but the well must have been pretty deep, because I had to use almost the entire length of rope. As soon as she was up, I hugged her tightly, and carried her to the car. She seemed fine though. Not a scratch on her body. Not even any dirt on her white summer dress. I rejoiced internally; my wife never had to know.

“Let’s go home, honey,” I said. “But let’s not tell mommy about this, OK? Wouldn’t want her to get worried.”

I glanced periodically at her in the rearview mirror on the way home, but she didn’t even seem phased. Maybe she was in shock? Or maybe kids are just better equipped to deal with shit like that? I shrugged mentally. Didn’t really matter. She was unharmed, physically. That’s the important part. Keep the innards on the inside, as they say.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

I started to worry already the moment we got home. Amelia had been silent the whole ride, and she didn’t seem like herself at all. That’s the thing though; I had absolutely no idea how she’d normally behave. Was she inquisitive and adventurous? Or was she all quiet and introverted? Parents should know these things, shouldn’t they?

She sauntered out of the car without so much as a glance my way, and quietly disappeared inside. I followed hesitantly, my mind racing to connect years of missing dots. 

“You wanna watch some TV?” I asked. “I bet your favorite show is on.”

I flipped through the channels idly. Sports, news, news, sports. Nothing that seemed even remotely interesting for children. After a while, I just sat down with her on the couch, twiddling my thumbs. It was becoming more and more apparent that I was hopelessly out of my element. 

“I like talking to faces,” Amelia whispered. “Inside-out faces, like in the ceiling.”

“That’s...interesting?” I offered. It wasn’t though. It was very unnerving. She was staring at the ceiling, an intense, unflinching gaze that sent shivers down my spine.

“If you listen, really, really, carefully,” she grimaced. “You can hear them talking back.”

I nodded weakly, and tried not to look directly at her. She had an active imagination, that much seemed clear. How had I not noticed this behaviour earlier?

“I’ll go fix us something to eat, OK?” I tried to feign a warm smile. “Are you hungry?”

She turned to me and nodded energetically. But it wasn’t a normal nod, you know? It was like she threw her head all the way back, then swung it forward with all her might. Kids, right? I shuddered briefly, and hurried to the kitchen.

“So what do you like?” I asked. “Peanut butter? Jelly? A combination thereof?”

“Anything with a soul,” her voice whispered right into my ear.

“Shit!” I shrieked, nearly slicing off a finger as I lost control over the breadknife. I turned on the dime, almost losing it again when I saw Amelia standing right behind me. I felt the knot in my stomach tightening again.

“Amelia, uh, honey,” I murmured. “Are you OK?”

She was pale as snow, her pallid face drained of all color. Her hair looked different too. How did it usually look? It wasn’t normally so sickly thin and greying, was it? And then there was the issue with her brown, rotting teeth. We took dental hygiene pretty seriously in our household, didn’t we?

“I’m famished,” she grinned. “Need sustenance.”

She seemed unnaturally gaunt. Just skin stretched over bones, her dress hanging limply from the lethargic frame. She used to look healthy and lifelike, right? I’m sure she did.

“Please, daddy,” she gurgled hideously. “Something living.”

She had to be sick. Some bug, or virus, or *something*. Maybe she did hurt herself down in that well after all? Caught an infection possibly? Maybe she had rabies? I panicked, my mind struggling to find references to what I should do next.

“Mom,” I whispered. “We need to call your mom.”

With trembling hands I grabbed my phone and called Diane. She’d know what to do. She always knew what to do.

“Honey?” her soft voice answered. “Is everything OK at home?”

“Uh, no, I mean, I don’t know, maybe,” I stammered. “It’s Amelia.”

Amelia smiled at the mention of her name. Only it wasn’t so much a smile as it was her lips curling back, revealing nothing but blackish flesh and rotting teeth. I swallowed deeply. 

“Amelia?” she asked.

“Yes, Amelia!” I yelled. “Our daughter.”

There was a long pause, and I could hear her breathing heavily on the other end. Amelia was inches away from my face now, her long, black tongue hanging out of her mouth limply. Her brown teeth were falling out one by one as the expanding tongue demanded ever more space.

“Noah,” Diane said, “Are you OK? Have you been drinking? Doing shrooms again?”

“What? No!” I yelled. “I *really* think there’s something wrong with our daughter! Why is that so hard to believe?”

Amelia put her writhing worm-like hand in mine, squeezing gently. Her black hole eyes beckoned me to put down the phone.

“It’s very hard to believe, Noah,” Diane said, pausing momentarily. “Because we don’t have any fucking [kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obscuratio/).”

I lay back on the couch at my apartment, a thick gauze bandage wrapped around my head. Olivia sat at my desk, booting up my laptop. My hands were shaking and my thoughts were sluggish. 

Half of my mind screamed at me to jump out the window. 

It was strange. A part of my mind was in control, aware that I was being followed by a creature that, as far as I knew, could only hurt me if I hurt myself. The other part was still screaming, thrashing in animal fear. Adrenaline coursed through my veins any time my mind strayed towards the thing following me.

Was he standing in the room? The crazed part of my brain urged me to look in a reflection, urged me to see where he was.

I bit the side of my cheek hard enough to draw blood. Resisting the urge to look around was like trying not to flinch at a gunshot.

Olivia’s voice cut through the haze. “Why am I looking up the victims?” 

I had been in a half-crazed state for an hour after seeing Marston, but I was pretty sure she’d driven me to my apartment after the police had questioned us. 

“Look up the first victim chronologically,” I said. “I want to know how this started. If I know how it started, it might give me a clue how to end it.”

Olivia clicked the mouse and typed a few keys. “Found her,” she said.

“Who?”

“Joanna Petty. Professor of History at the University of West Virginia.”

I nodded, slowly getting to my feet. “We need to go talk with her coworkers.” I pulled the bandage from my head, keeping my eyes firmly squeezed shut. 

“What are you doing?” Olivia asked, her voice incredulous.

“None of those professors are going to talk with me if I look like a paranoid lunatic. If I want information from them, I’ll have to act normal. I’ll keep my eyes shut for as long as I can.”

“Ok,” she said.

“And Olivia,” I said.

“Yeah?”

“If we don’t discover something soon, I’m going to have to kill myself in a way that no one will discover my body. It’s the only way.”

“We’ll find something,” she said.

Olivia guided me down to my car. I slid into the passenger seat, horribly aware of the rearview and passenger mirrors just a few feet from me. It took every ounce of my willpower to keep my eyes closed.

The backs of my eyelids were dark, which told me that the sun had set. There was also the familiar patter of rain on the top of my car. Driving through town to reach the college took just a few minutes. 

I stepped outside the car and opened my eyes. The red brick buildings were lit by streetlights regularly spaced out along the walking paths. The rain had just started, and the ground was still dry.

We made our way to the history building and let ourselves in. Plenty of students filled the halls and desks. We passed them all, heading for the office of Ms. Petty. 

I had taken some anti-anxiety medication to try and slow this thing down. It had worked, but it left me feeling slow minded and dumb. It seemed that my brain was moving so slowly that I could almost imagine each synapse firing individually. 

We reached the door to her office only to find that someone else had moved in. I cursed under my breath, but Olivia just knocked on the door.

An older man opened the door and looked both of us over. “Yeah?”

“Hi,” Olivia said. “I’m a student here at UWV. Joanne was my professor during my freshman year. I spent a lot of time in this office and… well… I just wanted to pass by. I didn’t realize that someone else had moved in.”

I shot her a look. We hadn’t planned any of that. 

The man nodded. “Yeah, she was a close friend of mine. Shame.”

“Do you know if there was anything interesting that she was working on or if she’d done any traveling before she… passed?” Olivia said.

“Yeah, she’d recently discovered a Native American archaeological site nearby. She’d been writing a paper on it.”

“We actually talked quite a bit about that sort of thing,” Olivia said. “Is there any way you could send me a copy of the paper?”

The man shrugged. “Sure. I doubt it’ll get finished anyway.”

Olivia I passed him her email address, we thanked him for his time, and then we made our way down the hallway. 

“That was impressive,” I said. 

Olivia shrugged, scrolling on her phone. “I figured it’d make sense for a student to— He sent it.”

We sat down on a couch beside the door. I felt a little better. I hadn’t seen any mirrors in the entire building outside Olivia’s phone, and I was making sure to keep my eyes away from that. 

Olivia printed out the rough draft on a nearby printer and handed it to me. I stuffed it into my bag and headed for the door. The rain was falling harder, coating the ground with large puddles. 

It was beautiful. We walked through the rain towards the car and I shot another look at the ground. 

I saw the creature in the puddle’s reflection. He was on the other side of it, making eye contact with me through the reflection. I fell to the ground and heard a strange shrieking and whimpering, only to realize that it was coming from me. 

“I have to end it,” I said to Olivia. “He’s right there. He’s right there.” I pointed to where he was standing.

She half dragged me to the car and drove us back to my apartment. I was delirious during the ride, the part of my brain that was still in control was fighting like mad to keep the crazed part from diving out the car door.

We reached my apartment. When I was back on my couch, Olivia pushed the report into my hands. “Read,” she said.

I opened my eyes and scanned the paper. My stomach dropped, andI began to laugh. 

“Jane?” She asked.

My laughter turned into coughing. “It wasn’t just a Native American village. It was a Native American burial ground. She probably found somebody who was trying to do exactly what I’m planning on doing.” 

I’d found Detective Marston's body. He’d found Jack’s body. And this woman had found a body buried a thousand years ago.

 I crumpled the paper in my hands. “I can feel myself slipping. We need to plan how I’m gonna do this.”


————

————

Hi everyone. This is Olivia. I can’t tell you all the details with what happened with Jane for obvious reasons, but know that we did the best we could to make sure no one would ever find her body. Our current solution involved a burial with a steel casket and a gun. It should work for a few years as I work on a more permanent solution. Maybe burial at sea. 

I just hope that this thing doesn’t somehow jump to me. I’m doing my best to not look in any mirrors.

fkwlz1,Our village used to make the most delicious but most peculiar pear juice in the world,likeeyedid,"How do you tell if someone is telling a lie? Look them straight in the eyes and ask a direct question to see if they will react nervously? Observe curiously if they will bite their lip, scratch their head or avoid eye contact? Well then you might want to improve your approach because that is how basically any person will react when being asked a question in a stressful situation. 

Wouldn’t it be nice if that was the case though? You could spot any lie easily and your life might be much easier. But well, that’s not how things go. Nervousness is not a reliable indicator for a lie, quite the opposite actually. 

I doubt that you will find yourself in a situation quite as unique as mine but just in case you do I have a few points you could pay attention to. 

Look a liar deep in the eyes. Focus and ask your question, if feasible. Now focus on their eyes and check out their pupils. If they lied, then their pupils probably dilated. Fabricating some fairytale takes a lot of mental effort after all!  Did you ever spot that before? Brilliant, you must be very detail-oriented!

Now you might not be able to get as close or maybe you missed the shrinking, then you could focus on the length of their answer. More words make us think that someone is a liar because well, they might be babbling random information but in reality lies are often shorter than truths. You may have guessed it already, this is also because making up information takes a lot of effort. We’re some really lazy people. 

Oh and this one is interesting: When lying, people tend to lift their head up. Very subtle but could be meaningful so closely watch someone’s chin. 

&#x200B;

\---

When you grow up in a place as strange as the community of the Folly’s then spotting a lie can be crucial for survival. Well, or if you hate pear juice but absolutely nobody in Folster hated pear juice. Our village was actually quite famous for it. If you ever had a sip of Folly’s pear juice you will never want to drink anything else. It is sweet, just a tiny bit sour and most importantly you can taste the love of the Folly’s that work hard for each and every bottle of the luscious nectar. Our village is surrounded by beautiful pear trees and everyone who grew up there helped out with the juice as well as they could. Some would harvest the pears, some would take care of the juice, some would bottle it all up and others would take care of the sales. I was assigned to one of the best tasks in my opinion. We don’t mass produce here. Every bottle is carefully and individually crafted, meaning that they all receive an original drawing on the bottle just underneath the ‘Folly’s peculiar pear juice’ logo that I or one of the other artists made.

Now we might sound like a very productive community to you but none of this would have been possible without one person in particular. 

*The wonderfully charismatic and aesthetic Connor Ashrow,* as everyone would always say.

He was the one who brought the pear business to Folster and improved everyone’s lives significantly. Or maybe the pears were always here and he just showed the people how to get the best out of them? I can’t tell you for sure as everyone I met in our village told me a different story about the rise of the peculiar pear business of Folster. Connor Ashrow came to Folster just a year before I was born, my mother Kristen told me. Back then things weren’t going well for the people here. Most of them, if not all, weren’t doing particularly well in life and the start of the pear business gave them a new sense of meaning. A change they had been longing for. But most importantly it gave them a family. Not everyone here used to feel like they belonged somewhere but eventually they found each other and Connor found them. Now everyone in Folster was happy, I wouldn’t know how things used to be before that. 

I spent my entire childhood and most of my adolescence there. I probably should have left the village from time to time, at least once. To find my own meaning in life or at least to visit places outside of Folster. There was supposed to be some town nearby with a terrific candy shop and another town that had been completely renovated lately. That’s where some of our juice was sold. But I didn’t. I always stayed in Folster. To me, this was exactly how life was supposed to be. 

We didn’t need much, just each other and our pears.

&#x200B;

\---

I assume I was about fifteen when my positive outlook on our life shifted a little. I had started to feel different, discovered new emotions. I stopped enjoying the regular activities, I didn’t enjoy any of the food that we cooked and pears started to disgust me. It didn’t come out of nowhere though, analyzing my behavior now in a logical manner gave me the answer: My heart had been broken for the first time. For months, hell years, I had a massive crush on one of the boys in my drawing class. 

Dylan. His eyes were just as green as mine and he was a terrific artist. He was funny and thoughtful and I enjoyed every moment around him. We’d meet up with some of the other kids in the village and play board games or tell each other stories. I never cared much for the other children but being around Dylan just felt right. 

But it shouldn’t have. I know that now. 

I always knew that I liked being around him but I had never known what falling for someone meant. Not until he started spending more and more time with one of the other girls. I resented her and him for liking her. That’s when I started realizing what jealousy was. Eventually I couldn’t keep these new feelings in anymore and I talked to Kristen about it. She had always been very understanding. She told me that this was totally fine and that there is no issue with sharing. 

“We are all one community after all- No, not simply a community. A family”

“But I don’t want to share. I want him to love me and no one but me.” I responded. 

Kristen gave me a sympathetic smile. 

”I remember very well when I had similar thoughts. It was frustrating seeing all these women pregnant from the man I loved but-.” she paused for a moment and I swear her pupils became tiny “it was rewarding.”

“Wait, what do you mean by pregnant? How much did you share?” I shrieked.

Kristen laughed “You don’t believe that the most lovable man in Folster is only *your* father, right? That would be very selfish of you” 

My crush quickly evaporated after that conversation and I discovered the feelings of hate and disgust.

That was the first moment of change for me. The first time that I realized that something was wrong with our village and the people that called themselves Folly’s. It was still my home though and I gained so many great memories there. Everyone was caring and nice but at that point there was no way I could turn off the doubt again. I didn’t exactly grow up in a traditional environment but something inside me knew damn well that falling in love with a sibling, even if it’s just a half sibling, was not right. It felt icky. 

After finding out what exactly Connor Ashrow had given to Folster, he was not exactly the father figure I used to admire. No matter how charismatic and admirable everyone thought he was. 

&#x200B;

\---

I assume I was about 19 when things here started changing for the worse. More people left the village. This hadn’t happened as long as I could remember but all of a sudden people would pack up their bare necessities and disappear into the night. Not even saying goodbye. More frequently than ever people from the outside world would show up and do check ups. I was never allowed to talk to them much which made me even more suspicious. 

But the final straw was that the pear business crashed and burned. We had a few years of terrible harvest and the juice had turned incredibly sour. There was far less work and everyone started getting extremely bored. But Connor promised that things would turn better soon. That something spectacular was waiting for us at the annual pear festival if we just kept going and stayed together: he had saved up a batch of the sweetest and most delicious bottles of peculiar pear juice and he decided that it would not be sold but instead be savored by the lovely people of Folster. The festival wasn’t coming for a few months though and so people became even more fussy over time. And there was even less to do.

They didn’t need many drawings anymore and as I wasn’t feeling much up to it anyway so I found something else to spend my time with. I had grown even more suspicious of Connor. I needed to know more about this man who apparently changed everything in our village for the better. So, one day when everyone was having dinner in the community hall, I snuck into his home. While he was the spouse and father of many here, nobody was allowed to live there with him, only short visits were accepted which made it obvious for me that he was hiding something in there. And what I found was something I could only have dreamed of. 

Books. Piles and piles of books. Not the type we had in our community school but real substance: books on history, persuasion and politics. Information that helped me understand what the world really was and what had been happening to us. And some helpful hints on how to analyze behaviour such as the things I told you in the beginning. I kept sneaking in regularly to gather more and more knowledge. 

When the day of the pear festival came, Connor was standing on top of a pedestal. He was talking about the future. About our community and life. How lucky we were to have each other.

“Brothers and sisters, finally our day has come. All of you had been patient and exemplary. Now it is time we take the next step in our journey. Yes, life has not treated us too well lately but that is over now.”

Connow Ashrow may have been incredibly smart but everyone slips up sometimes. He lifted his chin proudly and continued

“Drink the juice my children and our pears will grow and thrive. Let us toast to the bright future awaiting us!”

Liar.

I wasn’t completely sure what his lie actually meant, just that something about what he was saying wasn’t right. There was no bright future awaiting any of the Folly’s.

I screamed and shouted for them to stop. I even managed to push the glasses of a few people off their hands but for the majority it was too late. 

They had already finished the poison."

As I grew up I came to discover that I wasn't alone at all, it was only natural for kids to fear the darkness, that even some adults were wary of it. I also discovered as I grew up, that not everyone had a father like mine. A father that would go out of his way, to put me in that darkness.

A father that would pull my new nightlight from the socket by my bed and smash it to small plastic bits under his heavy boot. He would tell mother that I must have broken it somehow, I could tell that she knew he was lying. Her eyes looked sad all the time.

She would try to help me any way she could, always ushering me off to bed when dad stumbled through the front door. I remember thinking that he looked so tired, the way he swayed from side to side as I used to after soccer practice. I used to think the bottle in his hand was like the juice box mother would give me when I looked exhausted.

Every night it was the same. Mom would leave the door open just a crack so that the light from the hallway could slip in and vanish the dark corners. But every night my door would end up shutting, often before I was able to fall asleep. I could always tell who closed it. If the light slowly disappeared until I heard the faint click of the door lock, I knew mother had shut it.

After she closed the door I could always hear my parents talking back and forth rapidly, unable to make out their words. They sounded like muffled dogs. Mom was just trying to help when she shut the door, what's the point of letting the light in when the dark slips through anyway.

When Father closed the door it was sudden and harsh. The door meeting the frame like a car crash. It was almost as if my father wanted to make sure that I would wake up from the sound of the door shutting, so I could wake up surrounded by the night. I was always too afraid to get up from the bed and open the door again. I could never have been that kid that got to slip through the hall to sleep with their parents. I had only tried it once when the voices began.

It was after my Father slammed the door shut that I opened my eyes and laid silent on my bed staring off into the dark. In that silence I could hear them, small whispers filling my room like a cold breeze. Much like when my parents would argue through the walls I could never make out what was being said but I knew those voices were not my parents. It sounded like there were dozens of them all chatting to each other. A cacophony of secrets that plumed into my eardrums and rattled my heart.

I convinced myself that facing my father was the lesser of two evils and slowly climbed out of bed. Opening my door I walked timidly down the hall, it felt like that hall leading towards my parent's room stretched on forever when I was a kid. The architecture of the house giving me every chance I could to turn back. 

My small hands pressed open my parent's door but they weren't sleeping. Dad was sitting on the edge of the bed while Mom was curled up in bed. There wasn't much time to turn around, my dad's attention snapping to me faster than I could think. I had enough time to see a collection of juice boxes by my father's feet before he stood from the bed. I heard my mother offer a plea before the heavy footsteps approached my. 

His large open palm rested on my shoulder and for a moment I thought that I was going to receive some comfort. Instead, I felt my father's immense strength pushing me backward and lifting my feet off the ground. My back smacked against the hall's hardwood floor and before my approaching mother could cross the doorframe I saw Dad swing it shut with such a force I felt wind press against my wet cheeks.

I would have been able to sleep with the door open that night but I ended up closing it again when I heard my parents barking again. I was so scared to sleep the next night, so afraid of the voices and my dad. But when I laid down in my bed and my father slammed the door shut I opened my eyes to find, the room wasn't so dark.

Turning my head against the pillow I turned my attention to the ceiling. I thought that she must have done it while I was at school. Above my head was my very own night sky, a collection of shining white dots that littered the ceiling making it look like my room stretched into infinity. The lights were just bright enough to put my mind at ease.

Instead of nervously observing every bleak nook and cranny of my room, from that night on I would stare up at the stars. I would look at them until my vision got hazy and I needed to remember about blinking or until I would just pass out. When I looked at them long enough it felt like I was watching them move, like the stars were rotating around the room. Sometimes my vision would get so bad it looked like the lights were flickering.

I was so thankful for those lights. I wanted to thank my mom but I figured she wouldn't want me to bring it up. It was enough for her to see me getting better sleep, she would occasionally tell me how proud she was that I got over my fear of the darkness. Even though I hadn't really if it wasn't for the stars I would still be afraid but she looked so happy so I never told her. Seeing my mom happy wasn't something I got often so I cherished that too.

Night after night those stars kept me company and some part of me started to feel braver and braver. Even when I started hearing the whispers again, they just became another part of the night, another thing to keep my company. I even started closing my door so that my father didn't get the chance to slam it shut.

And then, the stars went away.


I could never forget that night. As I laid in bed starring up at the tiny freckles of white dotted around my ceiling I heard a door slam. Not mine but the front door, there were no whispers that night so I could hear every heavy footstep. My parent's started to bark but the bass of my dad's words was higher than I was used too. It felt like his words were shaking my bedframe.

On my back, I focused on the stars seemingly swaying above me as my mom's smaller footsteps raced up the stairs and my father's followed shortly after. I heard my mom gasp before there was a large thud in the living room. It sounded like when my father had pushed me down but it was louder and definitely shook my bed.

Even through the door, I could hear the soft sobs of my mother as she struggled to catch her breath. Sitting up, struggling to catch my breath as well I could see the shadows shifting and obstructing the light from the hallways from the bottom of my closed door. My dad uttered harsh demands to my mom.

She pleaded with him, still begging. I could feel the corners of my mouth lowering and my face becoming hot. I desperately wanted to do something, I felt it welling up in me and soaking my heart until it formed a lump in my throat. I looked up at the stars again, my vision obstructed by a thin film of tears gather. The lights looked warped under the filter of liquid that pooled until it streaked down my cheek.

The darkness around those stars swirled too until it looked like it was reaching out for me, all these shapes returned to normal when I wiped my eyes clean. Then I heard one more thud, this time it was soft and muted. I was reminded of what it sounded like when my foot would hit the soccer ball and then I heard my mother's air escaping her lungs.

Before I knew it I could feel the cool hardwood floor in my room pulling heat from the bottom of my feet. Quickly I made my way to the door and pulled it open letting the room flood with the hallway's light. I don't know what was going through my mind, probably nothing but I approached the man who had my mother's hair clumped up in his fist.

With all the strength my child's body could muster I swung and my small crumbled up fist landed on his left cheek. I put everything I could into it and he didn't move an inch, it was like he was made of stone or something. He turned to me, he was struggling to keep both eyes open and his breath smelled like battery acid but again, he was faster than I could think.

His massive hands wrapped around my arms and he picked me up off the ground with such little effort I felt like I didn't even exist. He smiled at me, an ugly and unkind smile and through the slurred speech he mockingly called me a “Big brave man.” before once again shoving me backward.

This time, with both his arms and the height he had brought me too, my body soared through the door frame and back into my room. I landed much harder and my thin frame bounced off the ground before resting. My breath had been taken out of me completely but still, my father stepped forward presenting his massive frame to tower over my crumbled body.

Leaning over he brought his face to mine. I could smell the intense waft of alcohol on his breath with each word he spoke. A sentence broken through such broken speech it was a wonder that I recognized it at all. He told me that If I ever touched him again, he would kill me. Lifting my head off the ground he quickly pushed it back down making it smash the ground, my vision jarred for a moment as he left the room. Slamming the door behind him.

All night, I laid on the floor, motionless and hardly able to breathe. I felt so powerless and just prayed that my mom was okay. The entire time I watched the stars above me and listened to the choir of whispers until I fell asleep.

Waking up, as sore as ever in my mom's arms I felt confused. The cool air was pressing against my face as my mother cradled me on the curb outside our home. I started to try and look around when I noticed the red and blue lights alternating around us. She rested her hand on my head and told me to keep my eyes on her. I did, mostly, but it was what was behind my mother that I focused on.

Real stars were hanging in the night sky above us. There were more whispers around me but they sounded different. I could hear footsteps all around us and the sound of running vehicles, I was curious but I was so tired and watching the actual stars mile and miles above me, I fell asleep embraced in my mother's arms.

The next day my mother explained that my Father, had been taken away by the police and she didn't think he'd be coming back. I didn't know how to feel but I knew there was a ping of relief in me, something to distract me from the pain in my body.

Mom was absent a lot after that, always leaving the house, I thought that maybe she had to get another job since dad was gone. She started looking happier as the days went on and in turn, I started to feel happy too as my body healed.

I was allowed to keep the door open at night so the hallway light could creep in and so that I could make sure my mother's steps were the only ones walking up the stairs. Since I was allowed to keep the door open I thought at the time that it made sense for my mom to take the stars down off the ceiling, even though I liked the. I didn't bring it up because things were getting better.


Not until recently anyways where I learned what happened to my father that night.


Years had passed and my mother lived in that house for all of them. She started to age and I went off to college. I recently returned to help her move her things, she was finally leaving that house behind. I always asked her to move over and get away from the horrible memories but she said she couldn't leave. She said she had memories of us in there too and that the house had a way of looking out for her. I would laugh it off but I was glad that she finally decided to make the move.

Guess she just didn't need a house that big all to herself anymore. So we went around the house boxing all her things up. I went into the attic and found boxes of my old childhood toys, I sorted through the boxes remembering the few chances I had to have fun in that house. I started to feel nostalgic for the stars that used to keep me company.

I thought about how they helped me cope with the darkness and how comfortable they made me feel. Then that maybe one day they would help my kid get through the night, should I ever decide to have one that is. The stars were nowhere to be found though. I sorted through all the boxes and could find a single on. Figuring she just threw them away I climbed down from the attic and asked her where she found the stars.

She looked puzzled which wasn't that surprising. She was getting on in her years and perhaps I needed to be more specific. I tried to remind her of the white dots that looked like stars she put all over my ceiling to help me with the dark. That the stars even made me feel better about the voices I was hearing. The same stars she took down after dad was arrested.

Her eyes fluttered for a moment before she sat down on the bed and instructed me to do the same. She began by telling me that my father, was never arrested. That night after he did what he did he went downstairs and my mother ran in to grab me. She scooped me up and pulled me into her room where she barricaded the door. 

She listened as my father ran around the house after noticing we weren't around anymore, he was far too drunk to even think that we were in the same room he slept in. She listened as he came back up the stairs, the steps nearly cracking under his frantic footsteps. My mother peeked through the door and watched as he walked into my room.

He looked around yelling my name, saying that if I didn't come out of hiding that I was going to be in big trouble. Then he stopped and looked around the room but with more curiosity than the anger he had before. Mom watched him slowly look up at the ceiling as if someone was calling for him. My dad stood there, framed by the door as he stood and stared at the stars on my ceiling. And then, my mother said, he started to lift off the ground.

It was so dark in the room that is was like the darkness itself was pulling him up and before she knew what to think, he was gone. She waited a moment before cautiously opening the bedroom door and stepping into the hall. Each step took minutes to get through she said as she made her way to my room. It sounded like it was far away, my father's screaming but she said it got louder and louder until it crescendoed when my father's body dropped from the ceiling and smacked against the floor.

In complete shock, my Mother managed to dial the police who also brought an ambulance with them but she said dad was far beyond saving. She said that with relief in her voice. She continued to explain that she had to meet with the police for a long time after that night which was why she was absent so often.

The police couldn't explain what happened but ended up ruling out my mother as a suspect in my father's death. Because the police had no idea what his cause of death was. They said it would have been physically impossible for a full-grown bear to do damage like that to a body, nevermind thinking my dainty mother could do it.

She said the closest thing the coroner could liken the damage to was someone falling from a plane a mile up and smacking against the pavement. She'd never get the shape of him out of her mind, the way his body had folded and pressed into itself. The way bones poked through the skin and how his eyes had rolled back. Even when looking at the complete decay of life that was my father, she felt warm that night.

She never questioned it, she had been dealing with the monster that was my father since before I was born and whatever monster it was that took him out of our life, she was thankful. That's when she said something that made my heart sink but also filled me with a sense of familiarity at the same time. She said to me that “Something must have been looking out for you.”

And I couldn't help but picture them. All the beady white orbs that hung above my head every night I closed my eyes. The white shining dots and the endless darkness around them. I found myself strangely thankful for them,


What I now know, were never [stars](https://twitter.com/Author_jo_jo)."
fko21t,I am a glacial researcher and what my team found in a mysterious tunnel in Iceland has left us questioning what we know about this world. [Part 3].,StairJumper,"About twenty-five minutes after Teresa answered my call on the walkie, my flashlight flickered. I smacked the back out of it, took the batteries out, but she would not turn back on. As I sat there in the eerie darkness with steam rising around me, I waited for the rest of the team to come get me. 


With no real sense of time, my patience was tested to the limits. I hummed over the bones, running my fingers along them, feeling how smooth they were. Then my fingers would touch the jagged puncture holes, each one a little bigger than a quarter. As my mind raced over the possibilities, a scream echoed from within the tunnel. 


As the scream filled the dark space around me, I jolted up only to be splashed by the hot water which burned my eyes as two bodies slammed into the water. What emerged from the water, holding two flashlights were Teresa and one of the local guides, each tethered with a strong rope. I ran out into the water to help them, careful not to damage the bones. 


When they regained themselves, I showed Teresa the bones with the guide, who introduced himself as Peja. Teresa looked upon the bones with similar amazement, quickly finding the puncture marks as I did. We locked eyes, both knowing what each other were thinking. While we came here researching one thing, I think we had stumbled upon something quite rare. 


While Teresa and I marveled over the bones, Peja called out to us from the farside of the cave. We rushed over, where he shown his flashlight down into the crystal waters. Within the waters, was a narrow rock tunnel leading straight down. My nerves couldn’t handle any more tunnels today but Peja was bolder. Before I could stop him, he jumped into the water, flashlight in mouth and dove under the surface. We watched as he shimmied he way down the narrow corridor before disappearing into the darkness of the tunnel, the flicker of his flashlight fading. What felt like hours, Peja’s body began to rise from the tunnel.


He rapidly ascended, breached the surface and took long deep gulps of air. While we waited in anticipation, our shock was overturned when a massive smile drew across his face ear to ear. We couldn’t help but smile with him.


Teresa radioed to the team to send down more people and to secure a more stable way of getting out of the tunnel. Teresa and I were going to follow Peja down into the tunnel as he was unable to explain in words what he had seen. All he let us know was that it was beautiful. Stricken by mystery and thrill for adventure, I stripped my clothes and got in the water with Teresa and Peja, the warm spring air warming over my body. With each of us taking large gulping breathes, Peja dove down, followed by Teresa, then myself. Before I went under, a raking sound resonated from within the cave walls. I treaded water there in the pitch black while the eerie sound closed around me. I dove under and chocked it up to me being alone in the cave for too long.


I shimmied my way down the narrow cave, watching the lights under me disappear. Hitting the bottom of the rocky tunnel, it took a sharp left. As I prepared for the turn I was met with Teresa’s face where she gave me thumbs before diving forward. The tunnel arched up and we emerged in a similar size pool. Breaching the surface, we found ourselves in familiar dark cave. Peja was already on land and told us to hang tight while he gets a light. We treaded water in the darkness, Teresa and I holding hands as Peja struck a flare. The whole room erupted in fiery red which reflected a cave structure filled with bright white crystals. 


The cave teemed with exquisite crystals I have never seen in my life. We stumbled out of the water, marveling at the wonders before us. Crystals ranging from the size of man protruded from every inch of the cave. The red flare radiating off the crystals like a life size kaleidoscope. We three wondered at the crystals before us, Peja bumped into us with a sly grin before bursting into tears. He knew what this meant and so did Teresa and I. The crystals were white as marble, sharp and jagged which lined the entirety of the cave. We radioed up to the basecamp who let us know that another team was coming down the tunnel. Further news that took me away from this moment was news that the tunnel Fajvan went down had collapsed. 


While I hummed over the news, the same racking sound resonated from within the cave. Teresa rushed over to me while Peja stood silently by the water’s edge frozen. We stood frozen while the sound pierced around us. Peja stood soley by the water, his lamp dangling from his side. The sound went quiet, yet faint steps began to emerge. I slowly lifted my flashlight towards Peja, seeing the steam rise off his body, his chest huffing and puffing. When my light hit behind him, our screams shook the cave.


Behind Peja stood a man of similar proportions. Motionless, he stood frozen like a mummy. But this was no ordinary man, where his head was supposed to be was replaced by the similar white jagged crystals. Protruding out of a fleshy pale head in a sickening manner. He seemed infused with the crystal walls, his feet trying to wrestle himself out from the crystals grasp. Peja stared intently at him, our lights reflecting off the being’s crystal lined head. Its mouth twisted about, revealing several gnawing teeth. Peja cursed at the creatue, who stood similar height yet pale and naked as the day you were born. 


Closer Peja got, Teresa and I called out to him, wanting to leave this instant. Peja grabbed a crystal protruding from the being’s head and gave a wicked yank. The being let out an animalistic yelp, Peja stood and laughed going again for a pull. Teresa cried out for him to stop, when he looked back at us, that sly grin cross his face. The creature pulled itself free from the crystal wall and sunk its teeth deep into Peja’s neck, blood sprayed about the crystal walls. Teresa let out a devastated wail as the creature mounted Peja, digging deeper into his neck. I dragged Teresa into the water, back through the tunnel we came from. 


We struggled swimming out, glimpses of the pale white creature mounting Peja ripping into him burned into my brain. We shimmied up the vertical tunnel and emrged in the first spring cave. Another team of researchers were already in the cave. We cried out and raced for the entrance tunnel. As were pulled out of the tunnel one by one, the racking screams resonated from within the tunnels once more. I heard the researchers question to one another as we were pulled closer to the earth’s surface. 


Teresa and I spent a great while talking over what happened, discussing how the hell we were going to tell the rest of the team. It is going to be a long night; the weather is taking a turn for the worst as wild howls of wind race across the empty ice fields. The team is worried for us, I don’t’ think they believe us. Hell, I wouldn’t believe us either. All I know is were going back into the crystal cave tomorrow, one way or another well prove to them what’s down there.
